    <h2>Policies</h2>


    <h3>Course Description</h3>
<p>The idea for the class is to take students through a series of exercises to motivate and illustrate key concepts in Economics with examples in Python Jupyter notebooks. The class will cover concepts from Introductory Economics, MIcroeconomic Theory, Econometrics, Development Economics, Environmental Economics  and Public Economics.  The course will give data science students a pathway to apply python programming and data science concepts within the discipline of economics.  The course will also give economics students  a pathway to apply programming to reinforce fundamental concepts and to advance the level of study in upper division coursework and possible thesis work.
</p>


<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>Students should have taken or are currently taking Data 8.</p>


<h3>Support</h3>
<p>You are not alone in this course; the staff and instructors are here to support you as you learn the material. It's expected that some aspects of the course will take time to master, and the best way to master challenging material is to ask questions. For online questions, use <a href="https://piazza.com/berkeley/fall2019/data88">Piazza</a>. We will also hold office hours for in-person discussions.</p>

<h3>Office Hours</h3>
<p>Dr. Van Dusen holds office hours on Fridays from __ to __ in Hearst Field Annex B. The Connector Assistants hold office hours on Mondays from 2pm to 4pm in 212 Cory. You are welcome to show up to any office hours.</p>


<!--
<h3>Waitlisted Students</h3>
<p>If you are on the waiting list, you must still do all coursework and complete labs and homework by the deadlines.  We will not be offering extensions if you are admitted into the course later. So it is your responsibility to stay up to date on the assignments.</p>
<p>You are welcome to attend lecture and lab while you are on the waiting list. Rooms may feel a little crowded in the first week.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, doing all the work is not a guarantee of enrollment. You will only be enrolled if there is space in your lab. Enrollment will proceed by CalCentral.</p>
<p>If you add the course after Week 1, you must contact your assigned Lab TA (see Staff Page) by email as soon as you add the course. The email must include your full name, Student ID number, date you added the course, and your @berkeley.edu email address. </p>
<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<p>The rest of this page details the policies that will be enforced in the Summer 2019 offering of this course. These policies are subject to change until the beginning of the semester and throughout the remainder of the course, at the judgement of the course staff. </p>
-->


<h3>Labs</h3>
<p>The weekly sessions will consist largely of two portions: a beginning lecture-based portion in which the concepts of teh week are laid out, and a second lab-based portion in which the concepts are applied in a group setting.</p>


<h3>Homework and Projects</h3>
<p>Weekly homework assignments are a required part of the course. Each student must submit each homework independently, but is allowed to discuss problems with other students and course staff. See the "Learning Cooperatively" section below.</p>
<p>Data science is about analyzing real-world data sets, and so a series of three projects involving real data are a required part of the course.</p>

<h3>Grades</h3>
<p>Grades will be assigned using the following weighted components:</p>
<style type="text/css">
.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;width:25%;}
.tg td{padding:4px 4px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;}
.tg th{padding:4px 4px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;}
.tg .tg-yw4l{vertical-align:top}
</style>

<table class="tg">
  <tr>
    <th class="tg-yw4l">Activity</th>
    <th class="tg-yw4l">Grade</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">Attendance &amp; Participation</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">20%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">Problem Sets</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">35%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">Projects</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">45%</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Every assignment is weighted equally in its category. For example, there are 3 projects, so each project is worth $\frac{45}{3} = 15 \%$ of your grade. </p>

<h3>Learning Cooperatively</h3>
<p>We encourage you to discuss course content with your friends and classmates as you are working on your weekly assignments. No matter what your academic background, you will definitely learn more in this class if you work with others than if you do not. Ask questions, answer questions, and share ideas liberally.</p>



<h3>Academic Honesty</h3>
<p>You must write your answers in your own words, and you must not share your completed work.</p>
<p>Make a serious attempt at every assignment yourself. If you get stuck, read the supporting code and lab discussion. After that, go ahead and discuss any remaining doubts with others, especially the course staff. That way you will get the most out of the discussion.</p>
<p>You are also not permitted to turn in answers or code that you have obtained from others. Not only is such copying dishonest, it misses the point of the assignments, which is not for you to find the answers somewhere and send them along to the staff. It is for you to figure out how to solve the problems, with the support available in the course.</p>
<p>Please read Berkeley's <a href="https://sa.berkeley.edu/code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a> carefully. Penalties for cheating at UC Berkeley are severe and include reporting to the <a href="https://sa.berkeley.edu/conduct">Center for Student Conduct</a>. They might also include a F in the course or even dismissal from the university. It's just not worth it.</p>
<p>Go on Piazza and discuss with other students or the CAs.   We expect that you will work with integrity and with respect for other members of the class, just as the course staff will work with integrity and with respect for you.</p>
