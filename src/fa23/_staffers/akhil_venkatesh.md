Hey everyone! I'm a junior double majoring in Data Science and Economics. If you like binging Kitchen Nightmares or other Gordon Ramsay shows, then I like you! I enjoy playing chess, tennis, and eating a ton of pizza in my spare time. Professionally, my interests lie in entrepreneurship, machine learning, and behavioral economics. I'm always looking to serve you all in the best way possible as I sincerely enjoyed taking this course. Looking forward to getting to know you at my office hours!
