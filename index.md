Data 88E - Economic Models 
========

Description
---
  This course is offered in partnership with the [Data Science Undergraduate Studies, College of Computing, Data Science, and Society](https://data.berkeley.edu/).  This course was built as a [Connector Course](https://cdss.berkeley.edu/data-science-connector-courses) to the popular [UC Berkeley Data 8 Course](https://data8.org).  The idea of the Connector Course is an in depth exploration of domain applications based on the concept and tools learned in Data 8.

About the course
---
**Data 88E: Economic Models** is a course offered at UC Berkeley as part of the **Data Science Connector Course** series. Itâ€™s designed to bridge the gap between data science and economics by using real-world datasets and Python programming to illustrate key economic concepts. The course is intended for students from both data science and economics backgrounds, giving them a chance to apply computational tools to economic models.

The course covers a range of topics including:
- **Introductory Economics**
- **Microeconomic Theory**
- **Econometrics**
- **Development Economics**
- **Environmental Economics**
- **Public Economics**

Students work with Python in Jupyter Notebooks to explore economic concepts such as supply and demand, market equilibrium, utility, game theory, and more. The course emphasizes how economic decisions are influenced by real-world data and policy interventions, making it a practical intersection of economics and data science

In addition, the course has been particularly valuable for data science students looking to apply their programming skills in economics and for economics students who want to reinforce their learning with computational tools, potentially aiding in advanced coursework and thesis preparation.
